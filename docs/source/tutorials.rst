============

Though the easiest way to get started with the library is to use the script ``simulation.py``, we include two jupyter notebooks to show the basic usage of the library. In particular, we show the case of the analytical Marchenko-Pastur distribution and the case of the empirical distribution of the eigenvalues of a random matrix.

For more information on the script ``simulation.py``, you can use ``python simulation.py --help`` to get the definition of all command line parameters.
