Installation
------------

You can install all dependencies using the ``requirements.txt`` file:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python -m venv venv/
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt

Notice that the code depends crucially on `py-pde <https://py-pde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

At the time of writing, ``python==3.10.12`` was used for the development.
